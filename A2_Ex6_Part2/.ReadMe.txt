Please note the following regarding the attached Java source files:

	Under the Server package, if you run the StartServer.bat/.sh file, it will start the server locally on your machine.
		
	HOWEVER: 
		Both the Client and Admin packages are currently setup to contact a sever already deployed on AWS.
		Please feel free to experiment with opening as many Clients as you like using the provided JAR file.
		
	The Admin app is ONLY required to initialize, reset and backup the database.

	The Swing GUIs for both the Client and Admin Packages were built using IntelliJ IDEA and therefore will not compile correctly
	outside of that IDE.  To run these packages, please execute the provided JAR files.  They will connect with the server deployed
	on AWS.  
	
	Thank you,
